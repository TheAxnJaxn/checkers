# Checkers Project for App Academy

https://github.com/appacademy/ruby-curriculum/blob/master/projects/w2d4-checkers.md

Needs fixes:
 - pieces can jump (instead of slide) with no enemy to kill
 - if you select a piece and try to move back, it goes to next player's turn

Need to add:
 - multiple jumps
 - custom errors that are raised
 - lots of refactoring and clean up
